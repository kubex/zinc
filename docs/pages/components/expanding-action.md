```html:preview
<zn-expanding-action icon="new_label" 
                     uri=""
                     method="fill"
                     count-uri=""
                     prefetch>
  This is the content here, this will probably be loaded from one of the URIs.
  if count uri is set, use that to retrieve the number to display as a notification
  if prefetch is set, we need to lod the uri which should have the count with it.
</zn-expanding-action>
```
